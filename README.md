## App for Microsoft's Social Good project

- Inspiration: One of our teammates was in the self-quarantine mode for 2 weeks in April. He had a lot of trouble getting the asian food due to the lack of home delivery service in Indian stores. We got inspiration from them.

- What it does: It helps people who are stuck in lockdown and are on a self-quarantine. It will help in flattening the curve for COVID-19

- How we built it: We used reactJS for the web-app, firebase to power the backend, and firebasio to manage the database. We hosted our site on google cloud and managed the code merging using Github.


How to run:
npm react install

npm start
